# Pytorch Learning
Install pytorch from [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) site by selecting appropriate options for CUDA, OS and Version. Do not directly install from pip as it may install the default CPU version which does not solve the main purpose to use GPUs

## Chapter 1: Pytorch Tensors
Refer to notebook [1. Pytorch Basic.ipynb](https://github.com/aravindm50/pytorch_learning/blob/main/1.%20Pytorch%20Basic.ipynb)

 1. Basic tensor initialization
 2. Arithmetic operations
 3. Calculating gradients
 4. Numpy interoperability
 
## Chapter 2: Pytorch Linear Regression
Refer to notebook [2. Linear Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/aravindm50/pytorch_learning/blob/main/2.%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

 1. Basic Linear Regression from scratch using diabetes dataset from sklearn with cuda
 
 Overfitting, cross validation and other related modelling concepts not covered.
 
## Chapter 3: Pytorch Logistic Regression
Refer to notebook [3. Logistic Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/aravindm50/pytorch_learning/blob/main/2.%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

 1. Basic Logistic Regression from scratch using MNIST dataset with cuda
 2. Training, validation data with sklearn train test split is also done for model validation
 3. Vanila Pytorch version is implemented first
 4. Pytorch Lightning version implement at the end for ease of use and code development

# Pytorch Learning
Install pytorch from [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) site by selecting appropriate options for CUDA, OS and Version. Do not directly install from pip as it may install the default CPU version which does not solve the main purpose to use GPUs

## Chapter 1: Pytorch Tensors
Refer to notebook [1. Pytorch Basic.ipynb](https://github.com/aravindm50/pytorch_learning/blob/main/1.%20Pytorch%20Basic.ipynb)

 1. Basic tensor initialization
 2. Arithmetic operations
 3. Calculating gradients
 4. Numpy interoperability
